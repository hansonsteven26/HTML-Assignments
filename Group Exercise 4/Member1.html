    <h1>Steven Hanson</h1>
    <div>
        <p>My favorite thing is spending time in front of my computer doing anything I want.</p>
        <p>On the side, I like to grow plants and mushrooms. Mostly plants though because mushrooms hate the air.</p>
        <p>I thought I wanted to be some kind of farmer/horticulturist, but I don't like manual labor, especially cause
            it doesn't pay so well.</p>
        <p>Now I'm going to a coding academy to learn the ways of the Programmer, so that I can be at a computer all the
            time, like the little nerd I am.</p>
        <p>Thank you and goodnight.</p>
